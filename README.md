# Context Fuse

Context Fuse is a script that aggregates data into a unified context file to enhance AI prompting.

It clones a given Git repository, scrapes all text-based files, and produces a single output file with clear file delimiters.

## Usage

Run the script with a repository URL as an argument:

```bash
./context-fuse.py <repository_url>
```
